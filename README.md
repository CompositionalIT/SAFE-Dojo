* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package manager
* [Node 8.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed for the front end components
* [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/) if you're running on Linux or OSX
* An F# code editor such as:
   * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Ionide](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp) extension
